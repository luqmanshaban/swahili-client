Introducing Swahili Plate: A Full-Stack Website for a Nairobi-based Restaurant

Swahili Plate is a well-known restaurant in Nairobi, renowned for its delicious Swahili cuisine. The restaurant has been operating for several years, and despite its popularity, it lacked an online presence. That's where I came in. As a developer, I was tasked with creating a full-stack website for Swahili Plate that would help the restaurant expand its reach and engage with its customers in a more meaningful way.

The primary objective of the project was to create a user-friendly and responsive website that would showcase the restaurant's menu, provide customers with a seamless online ordering experience, and enable the restaurant's management team to manage orders, menus, and customer data with ease. To achieve this, I chose to use a combination of front-end and back-end technologies that are widely used and well-suited for this type of project.

The front-end of the Swahili Plate website is built using React, JavaScript, MUI, SASS, and CSS. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and MUI is a UI framework that makes it easy to create responsive designs. SASS and CSS were used for styling and layout, respectively. The website's front-end is designed to be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and accessible on a range of devices.

The back-end of the website is built using Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and MySQL. Node.js is a popular open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that enables developers to build server-side applications. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, while Sequelize is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that allows developers to interact with databases using JavaScript. MySQL is a widely used relational database management system that is easy to use and scalable. These technologies were used to build the server-side functionality of the website, which includes order management, menu updates, and customer data management.

To ensure that the project is well-organized and easy to maintain, I chose to use Git for version control. Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, track changes, and collaborate more efficiently. By using Git, I was able to create branches for different features and merge changes seamlessly, without affecting the stability of the website.

In conclusion, building the Swahili Plate website was an exciting and challenging project that allowed me to use a range of front-end and back-end technologies to create a user-friendly and responsive website for a Nairobi-based restaurant. By using React, JavaScript, MUI, SASS, CSS, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, MySQL, and Git, I was able to create a website that met the client's needs, improved the restaurant's online presence, and provided customers with a seamless online ordering experience. I am proud of the outcome of this project and believe it will go a long way in helping Swahili Plate grow and thrive in the years to come
